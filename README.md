# new-virtualpet-practice
Post WCCI days, keeping my basics sharp by making a new virtual pet console app from the ground up.

This is a re-creation of the very first group project from my time at WCCI.  Using basic Java, If & If/Else statements as well as a Switch Case for the functionality of the application itself.  

My goal with re-creating this project as well as future projects is to keep my skills sharp at the basic levels, as practicing Katas and problems on CodingBat ect only get you so far.  

**IF YOU ARE A CURRENT STUDENT AT WE CAN CODE IT, OR ANY OTHER BOOTCAMP DOING A SIMILAR/SAME PROJECT!! PLEASE DO NOT COPY PASTE THIS CODE OR ANY CODE EVER!!  PLAGARISM IS BAD AND WILL GET YOU EXPELLED FASTER THAN YOU CAN GO 'HUH?!', SO PLEASE, FEEL FREE TO USE MY CODE AS A REFERENCE OR REACH OUT TO ME FOR ASSISTANCE IF YOU NEED BUT DO NOT EVER COPY AND PASTE AND CALL IT YOUR OWN!**
